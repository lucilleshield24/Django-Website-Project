# Django-Website-Project
This project creates my personal dynamic website using Django. 
The code is concentrated in urls.py, views.py, and models.py, as well as the html files. The website shows pages created through the admin interface. These pages are sorted into categories, which have the potential to be nested. I also added a side bar and header bar for better navigation.
Additional files that help the website run have not been included on GitHub, since I didn't make many changes to the code in those files.
